                     <a href="">Technical analysis has become increasingly popular over the past several years, as more and more investors,traders believe that the historic performance of a stock is a strong indication of future performance. The use of past performance should come as no surprise as the markets are known to move as per predictable trends and patterns.
                          These trends continue until something happens to change the trend, and until this change occurs, price levels are predictable.</a>
